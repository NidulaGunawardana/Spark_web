                            comprehensive knowledge of the surroundings. The primary goal of this phase is to determine
                            the concentration of contaminants at different atmospheric levels that harm the environment
                            and contribute to greenhouse gases. The plan is to achieve these targets by employing air
                            quality sensors and relevant electronic circuits. Considering the cost-inefficiency of
                            other popular approaches of monitoring air pollution, it has been decided to employ this
                            effective method to gather necessary information about our atmosphere.

                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">Power sub system plays a crucial role in Phoenix project which
                            is responsible for generating, storing and distributing power to the other four subsystems by integrating power management
                            and distribution electronics along with power sources. Following is an overview of the significant aspects of this subsystem.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">Given the high-altitude operation of the weather balloon and cube
                            satellite, numerous challenges must be overcome in this subsystem. The system should be able to operate in low temperatures
                            (as low as -75°C). Due to the lightweight nature of the mission, batteries with high energy density are required. Another
                            critical factor that should be focused on is battery duration. Several power-saving modes should be applied to supply power
                            throughout the entire mission duration. </p>
                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">There are different possible configurations that can be employed
                            to meet the expected requirements, including a single battery pack, a dual battery pack and an in-flight battery charging
                            system with solar panels.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">It has been decided to mainly use two power sources to supply
                            power to each component. One battery pack will be utilized for devices with higher power requirements that operate
                            for a shorter time, such as Raspberry Pi, cameras, etc. Another battery pack will be used for devices that require
                            operation for a longer duration, like communication or tracking devices. Additionally, another battery pack will be
                            used as a backup power source in case of a power failure. Both of these implementations would require an active heating
                            mechanism because battery performance decreases drastically at temperatures below -20°C/-40°C.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">For the battery charging method, series-connected solar panels
                            mounted on the payload box can be employed to charge batteries during the flight. However, the difficulty is that solar
                            panels require additional circuitry, including systems for battery charging and particularly MPPT regulators.</p>

                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">Battery selection is another factor that should be paid attention
                            to carefully. It is a well-known fact that the atmospheric temperature tends to decrease at higher altitudes. As battery
                            performance typically declines in low temperatures, a similar impact can be expected at high altitudes. There are many
                            possible batteries widely used in many applications, such as Li-SO2 , Ni-Cd and Lithium-ion. Let’s discuss the advantages
                            and drawbacks of each possible battery.</p>

                            <li class="list-group-item text-secondary lead">Lithium Sulfur Dioxide (Li-SO2) batteries have been found to satisfy

                                They also have better performance at low temperatures.</li>

                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">In the Pheonix project, there are some other issues that arise.
                            Because the voltage and current requirements of the various components differ, multiple voltage regulators and buck/boost
                            converters are required. To safeguard batteries from very low temperatures, passive insulation or the active heating method
                            would be appropriate. However, implementing active heating would add additional cost and increase power consumption. Another
                            challenge arises with balancing power across parallel battery strings.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">As a critical but challenging subsystem of the Phoenix project,
                            the power subsystem is responsible for a variety of functions. However, with the collective support and dedication of

                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">One notable advantage of LoRa packet radios is their simplicity compared to WiFi
                            or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). There's no need to worry about maintaining connections, as these modules handle packetization,
                            error correction, and auto-retransmission. This results in a more straightforward and power-efficient communication process.</p>

                                <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">In addition to the LoRa Radio Transceiver, a weather balloon project may incorporate a secondary
                                    communication device, such as the SPOT Trace Satellite Tracking device. Satellite trackers operate by relying on a network of satellites in orbit to receive
                                    position signals, offering global coverage as long as the antenna is pointed towards the sky.</p>

                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">The SPOT Trace is particularly effective for tracking payloads near and after landing. However,
                            it's essential to note its limitations, such as the inability to communicate beyond 18,000 meters in altitude. This makes the SPOT Trace a valuable
                            tool for post-landing tracking rather than continuous communication throughout the balloon's flight.</p>

                        <p class="lead mb-3 text-secondary my-auto text-justify">Together, these communication devices create a robust and comprehensive
                            subsystem for weather balloon projects. The LoRa Radio Transceiver at 433MHz provides an efficient and long-range solution
                            for real-time communication, while the SPOT Trace Satellite Tracking device serves as a reliable secondary option for
                            tracking payloads post-landing. The integration of these communication devices ensures a comprehensive and effective system
                            for gathering valuable information from the stratosphere.</p>
